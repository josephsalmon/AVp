# AVp

##Optimal Two Step Prediction: Adaptive Validation 

This code is associated with the article:

"Optimal two-step prediction in regression"
by Didier ChÃ©telat, Johannes Lederer, Joseph Salmon
and Available on ArXiV at http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5014


The Demo_AVP.py would provide an exemple of the Adaptive Validation on two cases:

-the Lasso
-the Thresholded Ridge Regression


##Dependencies
AVp is tested to work under Python 2.7.

The required dependencies to build the software are NumPy >= 1.6.2, SciPy >= 0.9 and a working C/C++ compiler,
and of course  scikit-learn > 0.15

For running the examples Seaborn>= 0.4.0 is required.
